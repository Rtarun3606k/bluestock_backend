1. `/db.sqlite3` will ignore the SQLite database file in the root directory. If you have database files in subdirectories, you may want to use `*.sqlite3` instead.
2. `/venv` will ignore the virtual environment folder in the root directory. If your virtual environment is located elsewhere, you may need to adjust this path.
3. `/**.pyc` will ignore all `.pyc` files in all directories, which is fine.
4. `/**/__pycache__/` will ignore all `__pycache__` directories in all directories, which is also fine.
